My name is Masahiro Mizukami. I'm a PhD of Computer Science in the AHC Lab in NAIST, Japan.
My research topic is Dialogue Systems.
I am particularly interested in System's Individuality Modeling.

I am working on [Interaction Research Group](http://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/icl/icl/interaction_research.html), [Innovative Communication Lab](http://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/rps/english/lab_e/nnovative_lab_e.html), [NTT Communication Science Laboratories](http://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/english/index.html) in Japan.
